# PAJI DA DHABA 

Project Title : PAJI DA DHABA

# Problem Statement: 
Develop a responsive website for a restaurant that can interact with customers and provide information about the menu, services, and amenities, and allow users to provide feedback.

# Project Description:
The core idea of this project is to develop a responsive and user-friendly website for Paji Da Dhaba. The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of an online presence for the restaurant, which makes it difficult for potential customers to find information about the menu, services, and amenities. Our solution is to create a website that provides all of this information in a clear and accessible way, while also allowing users to provide feedback and make reservations. The website will be designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with clear navigation, intuitive menus, and easy-to-use forms. Overall, the purpose and basic functionality of the website are clearly mapped to the problem statement and opportunity area.
